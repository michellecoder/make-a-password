# make-a-password

## Motivation

To learn how functions and for loops work.

## The Problem It Solves

The problem that is solved is that the password was not showing up in the 
display. The password now does show up in the display.

## What Did I Learn

This assignment was very difficult to do and I am not sure if I got everything. 
But the password shows up so tht is all I can ask for.
